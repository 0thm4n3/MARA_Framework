 Running the script
To run the script you can use the following command

    python pyssltest.py -i inp.txt -o inp.csv -n


I will explain each switches,

    -i <filename> :- A text file with target urls listed line by line 

    -o <filename> :- A csv file to which the output will be written 

    -n  :- Optional, To always initiate new tests. If this is omitted cached results from qualys is fetched 

Its pretty simple and fast way to run ssl labs against a bunch of servers.
